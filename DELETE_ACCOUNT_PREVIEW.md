## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run SQL Script

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Copy the entire contents of `DELETE_ACCOUNT_SQL_SETUP.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

**Expected Output**:
- Several "NOTICE" messages confirming updates
- A table showing all foreign keys with `delete_rule = 'CASCADE'`

**Verify**: All foreign keys pointing to `profiles(id)` or `auth.users(id)` should show `CASCADE` as the delete rule.

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Function

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "/Users/tianurien/Desktop/Code/PLAYR FIGMA"

# Deploy the delete-account function
supabase functions deploy delete-account
```

**Alternative** (if Supabase CLI not installed):
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Edge Functions
2. Click **Create Function**
3. Name: `delete-account`
4. Copy contents of `supabase/functions/delete-account/index.ts`
5. Paste into editor
6. Click **Deploy**

**Note**: You'll also need to create the `_shared/cors.ts` file in the Dashboard.

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

The edge function needs these environment variables (should already be set):
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Check**: In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Settings

### Step 4: Test in Development

```bash
# Start dev server
cd client
npm run dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Sign in as any user
3. Click your avatar ‚Üí "Delete Account"
4. Test the modal (type "DELETE" to enable button)
5. **Don't actually delete** - cancel instead

## üîí Security Features

1. **JWT Validation**: Only the account owner can delete their account
2. **Confirmation Required**: Must type "DELETE" (prevents accidental deletion)
3. **Service Role Key**: Edge function uses admin privileges securely
4. **Atomic Operations**: All deletes happen together or not at all
5. **Session Invalidation**: User is signed out after deletion
6. **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Passwords/tokens never logged

## üö® Important Notes

### For Production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Irreversible**: Once deleted, data cannot be recovered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Backup**: No automatic backups are created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediate**: Deletion happens instantly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Global**: Affects all devices/sessions

### For Development
- üß™ Test with disposable accounts only
- üß™ Don't delete real user data
- üß™ Verify CASCADE settings before deploying

### Known Limitations
- No "soft delete" option (all deletes are permanent)
- No grace period or account recovery
- No email confirmation before deletion
- No backup export before deletion

### Potential Enhancements (Future)
- Send email confirmation before deletion
- Add grace period (24-48 hours to cancel)
- Export user data before deletion
- Require re-authentication if session is old
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
