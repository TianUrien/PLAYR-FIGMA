- No empty placeholders for optional fields

### 🎯 Enhanced Profile Header

The profile header summary now shows a complete overview:

**Format:** `🇦🇷 Argentina • 📍 London • 🗓️ 26 years old • 🏑 Midfielder • 🏆 Holcombe Hockey Club`

**Display Logic:**
- **Nationality** - Always shown (with globe icon)
- **Base Location** - Always shown (with map pin icon)
- **Age** - Calculated from date_of_birth, only shown if date exists (with calendar icon)
- **Position** - Only shown if specified (with hockey stick emoji 🏑)
- **Current Club** - Only shown if specified (with trophy emoji 🏆)

**Age Calculation:**
- Automatically calculates precise age from date of birth
- Accounts for months and days (not just year)
- Displays as "26 years old" format

### 👤 Avatar in Navigation Bar

Updated `Header.tsx`:
- Desktop nav: Shows user's avatar next to their name

- Both sync with profile updates automatically

## 🚀 Next Step: Run the Migration

**You need to apply the database migration in Supabase:**

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nfprkbekdqwdvvxnryze/sql

2. **Copy the SQL from:**
   `supabase/migrations/20251011200000_add_player_profile_fields.sql`

3. **Paste and Run** the query

4. **Should see:** "Success. No rows returned"

## 🧪 Test the Features

After running the migration:

1. **Test New Fields:**
   - Click "Edit Profile" on Player Dashboard
   - Fill in Passport 1 (required)
   - Optionally fill Passport 2 and Current Club
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify fields display in Basic Information

2. **Test Conditional Display:**
   - Leave Passport 2 empty
   - Save profile
   - Verify Passport 2 section doesn't show
   - Fill it in, save again
   - Verify it now appears

3. **Test Enhanced Header:**
   - With position and current club filled: should see full summary
   - Without position: summary excludes position
   - Without current club: summary excludes club
   - Age displays correctly based on date of birth

4. **Test Avatar in Navbar:**
   - Upload or change profile photo
   - Check top navigation bar - avatar should update immediately
   - Check mobile menu - avatar should update there too
   - Sign out and sign in - avatar persists
