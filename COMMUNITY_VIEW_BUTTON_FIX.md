# 🐛 Bug Fix Preview - Community Page View Button Navigation

## 🔍 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Clicking "View" button on member cards was redirecting to `/profile/{id}` which doesn't exist or incorrectly redirected to the logged-in user's dashboard.

**Solution**: Updated navigation to use correct public profile routes based on user role.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### File Modified: `client/src/components/MemberCard.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
const handleViewProfile = () => {
  navigate(`/profile/${id}`)
}
```

**After**:
```tsx
const handleViewProfile = () => {
  // Navigate to correct public profile based on role
  if (role === 'club') {
    navigate(`/clubs/id/${id}`)
  } else {
    // Players and Coaches use player profile route
    navigate(`/players/id/${id}`)
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Expected Behavior After Fix

### 1. **Player Cards**
- **Click "View"** on a player card (e.g., "Valentina Turienzo")
- **Navigates to**: `/players/id/{playerId}`
- **Loads**: That player's public profile page
- **Shows**: Player's full profile data from Supabase

### 2. **Coach Cards**
- **Click "View"** on a coach card
- **Navigates to**: `/players/id/{coachId}`
- **Loads**: That coach's public profile page
- **Shows**: Coach's profile data (same page structure as players)

### 3. **Club Cards**
- **Click "View"** on a club card (e.g., "CASI", "Holcombe Hockey Club")
- **Navigates to**: `/clubs/id/{clubId}`
- **Loads**: That club's public profile page
- **Shows**: Club's full profile data from Supabase

## 🧭 Route Logic

The fix implements role-based routing:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Member Card "View" Button Clicked       │
└──────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
         Check Role Type
               │
       ┌───────┴───────┐
       │               │
       ▼               ▼
    role = 'club'   role = 'player' or 'coach'
       │               │
       ▼               ▼
  /clubs/id/{id}  /players/id/{id}
       │               │
       ▼               ▼
  PublicClubProfile  PublicPlayerProfile
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Dev server running**: http://localhost:5173/
2. **Test data**: Have at least one Player, Coach, and Club in your Supabase `profiles` table
3. **Existing routes**: Ensure `/players/id/:id` and `/clubs/id/:id` routes exist and are functional

### Test Steps

#### Test 1: Player Profile Navigation
1. Navigate to Community page: http://localhost:5173/community
2. Find a **Player** card (blue badge)
3. Click the **"View"** button
4. **Expected**: URL changes to `/players/id/{playerId}`
5. **Expected**: Player's public profile page loads with correct data
6. **Verify**: Shows that player's info, NOT your own profile

#### Test 2: Coach Profile Navigation
1. Go back to Community page
2. Find a **Coach** card (purple badge)
3. Click the **"View"** button
4. **Expected**: URL changes to `/players/id/{coachId}`
5. **Expected**: Coach's public profile page loads with correct data
6. **Verify**: Shows that coach's info, NOT your own profile

#### Test 3: Club Profile Navigation
1. Go back to Community page
2. Find a **Club** card (orange badge)
3. Click the **"View"** button
4. **Expected**: URL changes to `/clubs/id/{clubId}`
5. **Expected**: Club's public profile page loads with correct data
6. **Verify**: Shows that club's info, NOT your own profile

#### Test 4: Message Button (Unchanged)
1. Go back to Community page
2. Click **"Message"** button on any card
3. **Expected**: 
   - If authenticated: Creates/opens conversation with that user
   - If guest: Redirects to sign-in page
4. **Verify**: Message functionality still works correctly

## 🔗 Related Routes

The fix relies on these existing routes in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
// Existing player routes
<Route path="/players/:username" element={<PublicPlayerProfile />} />
<Route path="/players/id/:id" element={<PublicPlayerProfile />} />

// Existing club routes
<Route path="/clubs/:username" element={<PublicClubProfile />} />
<Route path="/clubs/id/:id" element={<PublicClubProfile />} />
```

**Note**: We're using ID-based routes (`/players/id/{id}`) because:
- More reliable than username (which might not be set)
- Direct database lookup by `id` field
- Consistent across all user types

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Before Fix ❌
```
User clicks "View" on Valentina's card
  ↓
Navigates to /profile/valentina-id
  ↓
Route doesn't exist or redirects to own profile
  ↓
User sees THEIR OWN profile, not Valentina's ❌
```

### After Fix ✅
```
User clicks "View" on Valentina's card
  ↓
Check role: 'player'
  ↓
Navigates to /players/id/valentina-id
  ↓
PublicPlayerProfile loads
  ↓
User sees VALENTINA'S profile ✅
```

## 🚨 Edge Cases Handled

1. **Player without username**: Uses ID-based route (no issue)
2. **Coach profile**: Routes to player-style profile (coaches are users too)
3. **Club profile**: Routes to dedicated club profile page
4. **Invalid ID**: Will be handled by PublicPlayerProfile/PublicClubProfile error states
5. **Guest users**: Can still view profiles (public access maintained)

## 🔄 No Breaking Changes

- ✅ Message button functionality: **Unchanged**
- ✅ Other navigation: **Unchanged**
- ✅ Public profile pages: **Unchanged**
- ✅ Auth flow: **Unchanged**
- ✅ Only change**: View button now uses correct routes

## 📊 Technical Details

### Why ID-based routes?
- **Usernames are optional**: Not all users have set a username
- **Database primary key**: Direct lookup by `id` is faster
- **Fallback support**: Existing routes support both username and ID
- **Consistency**: All roles can use ID-based navigation

### Why Coaches → Player Route?
- Coaches are individual users (not organizations like clubs)
- They may have player history, positions, stats
- Reuses existing PublicPlayerProfile component
- Reduces code duplication

### Alternative Approach (Not Used)
We could check for username first:
```tsx
if (username) {
  navigate(`/players/${username}`)
} else {
  navigate(`/players/id/${id}`)
}
```
But this adds complexity and username field isn't guaranteed to be present.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After testing, please verify:

- [ ] Player "View" button → Correct player profile loads
- [ ] Coach "View" button → Correct coach profile loads
- [ ] Club "View" button → Correct club profile loads
- [ ] URL changes to correct route format
- [ ] Profile data matches the clicked member (not logged-in user)
- [ ] Message button still works correctly
- [ ] Back button navigation works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on small screen)
- [ ] Works for both authenticated and guest users

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Profile page shows wrong user
- **Check**: Is the `PublicPlayerProfile`/`PublicClubProfile` component fetching data using the URL parameter `id`?
- **Verify**: Component should use `useParams()` to get the ID from URL
- **Confirm**: Not using `useAuthStore().user.id` (that's the logged-in user)

### 404 or route not found
- **Check**: Routes exist in `App.tsx`: `/players/id/:id` and `/clubs/id/:id`
- **Verify**: IDs in database are valid UUIDs
- **Test**: Manually visit the URL to confirm route works

### Message button broken
- **Unlikely**: Message functionality wasn't modified
- **Check**: Console for errors
- **Verify**: Supabase connection working
