## 📱 **Expected User Experience**

### **Mobile User Journey:**

1. **Lands on hero** → Sees PLAYR logo, headline centered
2. **Scrolls down** → Sees "Join PLAYR" button (purple, prominent)
3. **Clicks "Join PLAYR"** → Goes to signup page
4. **OR scrolls to sign-in** → Sees white panel, easy to read
5. **Fills form** → Dark labels on white background, clear inputs
6. **Signs in** → Redirects to dashboard

**Pain Points Solved:**
- ❌ Before: Cramped two columns, hard to read
- ✅ After: Clean single column, clear hierarchy

### **Desktop User Journey:**

1. **Lands on hero** → Sees familiar two-column layout
2. **Views hero content** → Left side, same as before
3. **Sees sign-in panel** → Right side, glassmorphism effect
4. **Fills form** → Same experience as before
5. **Signs in** → Redirects to dashboard

**Pain Points Solved:**
- ✅ None - desktop was already good, left unchanged
