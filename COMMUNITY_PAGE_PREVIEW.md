## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Fetch 200 most recent profiles from Supabase
2. **Client Filter**: Apply role filter instantly (no API call)
3. **Search**: 
   - Empty query → Reset to initial load
   - Non-empty query → Debounce 500ms → Server query with `.ilike` on 5 fields
4. **Pagination**: Slice filteredMembers array, increment page, update displayed

### Database Fields Used
From `profiles` table:
- `id` (string)
- `avatar_url` (string | null)
- `full_name` (string)
- `role` (string: 'player' | 'coach' | 'club')
- `nationality` (string | null)
- `base_location` (string | null)
- `position` (string | null)
- `current_club` (string | null) ← **Note**: This is the correct field name in DB
- `created_at` (timestamp)

### Performance Optimizations
- Initial batch: 200 profiles (reasonable for client-side filtering)
- Search debounce: 500ms (reduces API calls)
- Lazy-loaded avatars (faster initial render)
- Memoized filtered results (useMemo)
- Conditional field rendering (no empty divs)
