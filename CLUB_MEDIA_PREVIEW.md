## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema**
Created `club_media` table with:
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `club_id` - FK to profiles table
- `file_url` - Storage URL
- `file_name` - Original filename
- `file_size` - File size in bytes
- `caption` - Optional caption (max 200 chars)
- `alt_text` - Optional alt text for accessibility
- `order_index` - For drag-and-drop ordering
- `is_featured` - Future-proof field (not used in UI yet)
- `created_at` - Upload timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last modified timestamp

**Indexes**: 
- `idx_club_media_club_id` (for efficient club lookups)
- `idx_club_media_order` (for ordering queries)

**Constraints**:
- Caption max length: 200 characters
- Hard delete (no soft delete)

### 2. **TypeScript Types**
Updated `client/src/lib/database.types.ts`:
- Added `club_media` table definition
- Exported `ClubMedia`, `ClubMediaInsert`, `ClubMediaUpdate` types
- Full TypeScript support for all fields

### 3. **Components Created**

#### `ClubMediaTab.tsx` (540 lines)
Full-featured gallery management component:

**Features**:
- **Upload**: 
  - Multi-file upload (up to 10 files at once)

  - File validation (type, size)
  - Progress bars for each file
  - Success/error indicators
  
- **Gallery Grid**:
  - Responsive layout (4/3/2/1 columns)

  - Edit captions (inline editing)
  - Edit alt text (accessibility)
  - Upload date display
  
- **States**:
  - Loading state
  - Empty state (drag & drop zone)

- Media tab now fully functional

#### `PublicClubProfile.tsx`
- Already uses `ClubDashboard` with `readOnly={true}`

## üóÑÔ∏è Supabase Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket

Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create Bucket:

```
Bucket name: club-media
Public: ‚úÖ YES (enable public access)
File size limit: 10485760 (10 MB)
Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
```

### Step 2: Apply RLS Policies to Storage Bucket

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow public to view/download club media
CREATE POLICY "Public can view club media"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'club-media');

-- Allow clubs to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can upload own media"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'club-media' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow clubs to update their own files
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can update own media"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'club-media' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow clubs to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can delete own media"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'club-media' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### Step 3: Create Database Table

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create club_media table for club photo gallery
CREATE TABLE public.club_media (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  club_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_url text NOT NULL,
  file_name text NOT NULL,
  file_size integer NOT NULL,
  caption text,
  alt_text text,
  order_index integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_featured boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Indexes for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_club_media_club_id ON public.club_media (club_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_club_media_order ON public.club_media (club_id, order_index, created_at DESC);

-- Caption length constraint
ALTER TABLE public.club_media
  ADD CONSTRAINT caption_max_length CHECK (char_length(caption) <= 200 OR caption IS NULL);
```

### Step 4: Apply RLS Policies to Database Table

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.club_media ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Clubs can insert their own media
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can insert own media"
ON public.club_media
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = club_id);

-- Policy: Clubs can update their own media
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can update own media"
ON public.club_media
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = club_id);

-- Policy: Clubs can delete their own media
CREATE POLICY "Clubs can delete own media"
ON public.club_media
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = club_id);

-- Policy: Everyone can view club media (public read)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view club media"
ON public.club_media
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

## üìù Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. ‚ú® `client/src/components/ClubMediaTab.tsx` (540 lines)
2. ‚ú® `client/src/components/ClubMediaGallery.tsx` (110 lines)
3. ‚ú® `CLUB_MEDIA_PREVIEW.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
4. üìù `client/src/lib/database.types.ts` - Added club_media types
5. üìù `client/src/pages/ClubDashboard.tsx` - Integrated ClubMediaTab

**Total**: 5 files, ~700 lines of new code

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Storage Path Structure
Files are stored with this path pattern:
```
club-media/{club_id}/{timestamp}_{random}.{ext}
```

Example:
```
club-media/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/1729435200000_abc123.jpg
```

This ensures:
- Files are organized by club
- Filenames are unique (no collisions)
- RLS policies can enforce ownership

### RLS Security
The RLS policies ensure:
- ‚úÖ Clubs can only upload/edit/delete their own media
- ‚úÖ Public can view all club media (read-only)
- ‚úÖ No cross-club editing/deletion possible
- ‚úÖ Storage and database are both protected

### Ordering Logic
Photos are ordered by:
1. `order_index` (ASC) - Manual drag-and-drop order
2. `created_at` (DESC) - Newest first (for ties)

New uploads get `order_index = max(existing) + 1`, appending to the end.

## üìû Support & Questions

### If Issues Arise

**Upload fails**:

**Next**: Please run the Supabase SQL scripts above, then test the Media tab in your club dashboard! üöÄ

Let me know once Supabase is set up and I can start the dev server for testing!
