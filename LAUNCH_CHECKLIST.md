### Day 3: Error Handling (Phase 2)
- [ ] Add ErrorBoundary to `client/src/main.tsx`
- [ ] Build and test: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test error boundary by throwing test error
- [ ] Verify user sees friendly error page
- [ ] Remove test error
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Error boundary catches errors ✅

### Day 4-5: Basic Monitoring (Phase 3)

- [ ] Verify connection pool doesn't exhaust
- [ ] Check for errors in test output
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** 100 users handled ✅

### Day 4: Load Testing - Full Scale
- [ ] Run test with 200 users: `k6 run load-tests/basic-load-test.js`
- [ ] Monitor Supabase Dashboard in real-time
- [ ] Watch for:
  - P95 latency < 400ms ✅
  - Error rate < 1% ✅
  - Database CPU < 80% ✅
  - No connection pool exhaustion ✅
- [ ] Take screenshots of results
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** 200 users test passes ✅

### Day 5: Issue Resolution
- [ ] Review load test results
- [ ] Identify any failed thresholds
- [ ] Check slow operations: `monitor.getSlowOperations()`
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow queries
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- [ ] Re-run load test
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** All issues resolved ✅

---

## 🗓️ Week 4: Final Preparation

### Day 1-2: Production Build Testing
- [ ] Build production version: `npm run build`
- [ ] Preview build: `npm run preview`
- [ ] Test all critical features in preview
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check bundle size (should be reasonable)
- [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Production build works ✅

### Day 3: Staging Environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment (Vercel/Netlify)
- [ ] Point to production Supabase (or staging DB)
- [ ] Test all features end-to-end
- [ ] Have 2-3 friends test simultaneously
- [ ] Check monitor stats
- [ ] Check Supabase Dashboard for any errors
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Staging works perfectly ✅

### Day 4: 24-Hour Monitoring
- [ ] Keep staging environment running
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Check for memory leaks (browser DevTools → Memory)

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found after launch:

### Database Issues
```bash
# Rollback last migration
supabase db reset --db-url <your-db-url>

# Or manually drop problematic indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_name;
```

### Frontend Issues
- Deploy previous version from Vercel/Netlify dashboard
- Or disable problematic features with feature flags
- Monitor shows which operation is failing

### When to Rollback
- Error rate > 10% for 5 minutes
- Database CPU > 95% for 10 minutes
- P95 latency > 2 seconds consistently
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Critical feature completely broken
