# Player ↔ Club Public Profiles & Vacancy Flow - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. Database Schema (Migrations Created)

  - Created `vacancy_applications` table with all required fields
  - Added RLS policies for clubs and players
  - Indexes for performance
  - Status enum: pending, reviewed, shortlisted, interview, accepted, rejected, withdrawn
  - Unique constraint on (vacancy_id, player_id) to prevent duplicate applications

- **`20251012000000_add_username_to_profiles.sql`**

  - `VacancyApplicationWithPlayer` interface (includes player profile data)

### 3. Components Created

- Displays player photo, name, position, location, applied date
- Photo and name are clickable → navigates to public player profile
- "View Profile" button

### 4. Public Profile Pages

## 🔧 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

You need to run these two migrations in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nfprkbekdqwdvvxnryze/sql

2. Copy and paste the contents of **`supabase/migrations/20251011235900_create_vacancy_applications.sql`**
   - This creates the applications table with RLS policies

3. Copy and paste the contents of **`supabase/migrations/20251012000000_add_username_to_profiles.sql`**
   - This adds username field for clean URLs

4. Run both migrations

### Step 2: (Optional) Add Usernames to Existing Profiles

If you have existing player/club profiles, you'll want to add usernames to them:

```sql
-- Example: Update profiles with usernames
UPDATE profiles 
SET username = LOWER(REPLACE(full_name, ' ', '-')) 
WHERE username IS NULL;

-- Or manually set usernames via the profiles table
```

Without usernames, public profiles will use ID-based URLs (`/players/id/uuid` instead of `/players/john-doe`).

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **As a Club:**
   - Sign in as a club
   - Go to Dashboard → Vacancies tab
   - Create and publish a vacancy
   - Notice the "👥 0 Applicants" button appears on open vacancies

2. **As a Player:**
   - Sign in as a player
   - Go to Opportunities page (`/opportunities`)
   - Find a vacancy and click "Apply" (you'll need to implement the Apply button/modal)
   - Application should be saved to `vacancy_applications` table

3. **As a Club (view applicants):**
   - Return to Dashboard → Vacancies
   - Click "👥 X Applicants" button
   - See list of applicants
   - Click player name/photo or "View Profile"
   - You're taken to the player's public profile (read-only mode)
   - Notice "Public View" badge in header

4. **As a Player (view club):**
   - On Opportunities page, click a club name/logo
   - You're taken to the club's public profile (read-only mode)
   - See Overview, Media, and Vacancies tabs
   - Notice "Public View" badge in header

## 🔐 Security (RLS Policies)

### Vacancy Applications Table

1. **Clubs can view applications to their vacancies**
   - `SELECT` policy checks if club owns the vacancy

2. **Players can view their own applications**
   - `SELECT` policy checks `player_id = auth.uid()`

3. **Only players can create applications**
   - `INSERT` policy ensures user is a player

4. **Only vacancy owners can update application status**
   - `UPDATE` policy for clubs to change status

5. **Players can withdraw their own applications**
   - `UPDATE` policy allows setting status to 'withdrawn'

## 🚀 Next Steps (For Later)

1. **Implement Apply Button**
   - Create `ApplyToVacancyModal` component
   - Form with cover letter textarea
   - Submit to `vacancy_applications` table
   - Show success/error states

2. **Update Vacancy Cards on Opportunities Page**
   - Make club name/logo clickable
   - Add `onClick` handlers to navigate to `/clubs/:username`

3. **Handle "Applied" State**
   - Check if current player already applied
   - Show "Applied ✓" instead of "Apply" button
   - Disable button if already applied

4. **Message Button (Optional)**
   - Add messaging system between clubs and players
   - Or simple "Contact via Email" functionality

5. **Application Status Management**
   - Club dashboard to update applicant status
   - Email notifications for status changes
   - Player dashboard to view application history
