## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Tests
1. Navigate to Community page from header
2. Test search with member names, locations, positions
3. Click role filter chips (All, Players, Coaches, Clubs)
4. Verify responsive grid on different screen sizes
5. Test Message button (auth required)
6. Test View Profile button (public access)
7. Scroll and click Load More (if applicable)
8. Check empty states (search for nonsense)

### Edge Cases
- Empty database (no members)
- Single member result
- No search results
- Guest user clicking Message (should redirect to sign-in)
- Long names, missing fields (should hide gracefully)

## 🎨 Design Consistency

The Community page follows PLAYR's design system:
- **Gradient**: `from-[#6366f1] to-[#8b5cf6]` (indigo-purple)
- **Typography**: Same scale as other pages
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding/margins
- **Cards**: White background, gray-200 borders, hover shadow
- **Buttons**: Gradient primary, gray secondary
- **Role badges**: Color-coded (blue/purple/orange)

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

- **Page**: Public (no auth required to view)
- **Message action**: Requires authentication
- **View Profile action**: Public access
- **Data**: Read-only access to public profiles
- **Validation**: Server-side search sanitization

## 🐛 Known Non-Issues

The following linter warnings are **non-blocking** and follow the same pattern as other pages in the codebase:
- `useEffect` dependency warnings
- Pre-existing in similar components
- Do not affect functionality
- Can be addressed in future refactoring

## 📞 Support Notes

### If Issues Arise
1. **Navbar not showing**: Clear browser cache, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Search not working**: Check Supabase connection, verify profiles table
3. **Empty results**: Confirm profiles exist in database with valid data
4. **Message error**: Verify conversations table exists and has correct permissions
5. **Layout broken**: Check Tailwind CSS is loading, inspect responsive classes

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Rebuild the project
cd client && npm run build

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Check for errors
npm run lint

# Verify Supabase connection
# Check .env.local for VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
