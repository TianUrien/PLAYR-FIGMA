📍 Hash: #access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ik...

## ❌ If You See "Verification Link Invalid"

**DON'T PANIC!** Check console:

### Bad Output (Broken):
```
📍 Hash: (empty)
🔑 Has access_token: false
❌ Empty hash detected
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. ⏳ **Vercel still deploying** → Wait 2 more minutes
2. 🔄 **Browser cache** → Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. 📧 **Old email link** → Delete account and signup again with DIFFERENT email
4. 🌐 **Incognito not used** → Retry in incognito mode

### Quick Fix:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Delete test account again
3. Wait 5 minutes for Vercel
4. Retry with **brand new email**
