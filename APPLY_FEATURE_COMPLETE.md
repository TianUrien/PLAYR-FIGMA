# 🎉 Apply to Vacancy Feature - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **ApplyToVacancyModal Component**
**File:** `client/src/components/ApplyToVacancyModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- Clean modal UI with vacancy details summary
- Optional cover letter textarea (with character count)
- Success/error state handling
- Duplicate application detection (shows error if already applied)
- Loading state during submission
- "What happens next?" info box
- Submission creates row in `vacancy_applications` table with status 'pending'

**Props:**
- `isOpen` - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose` - Close handler
- `vacancy` - Vacancy object to apply to
- `onSuccess` - Callback after successful application

### 2. **OpportunitiesPage Updates**
**File:** `client/src/pages/OpportunitiesPage.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Fetches user's applications on mount
- Tracks applied vacancies in state (`userApplications` Set)
- Shows "✓ Applied" button for vacancies already applied to
- Shows "Apply Now" button for vacancies not applied to
- Opens ApplyToVacancyModal when clicking Apply
- Refreshes applications list after successful submission
- Shows success alert after applying

**New State:**
```typescript
const [userApplications, setUserApplications] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [selectedVacancy, setSelectedVacancy] = useState<Vacancy | null>(null)
const [showApplyModal, setShowApplyModal] = useState(false)
```

**New Function:**
```typescript
fetchUserApplications() // Fetches all vacancies current player has applied to
```

### 3. **VacancyCard Updates**
**File:** `client/src/components/VacancyCard.tsx`

Already had the necessary props and UI logic:
- `onApply?: () => void` - Handler for Apply button
- `hasApplied?: boolean` - Shows "✓ Applied" state
- Conditional rendering: Applied > Apply > View Details
